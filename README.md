## Key Decisions

### JWT in localStorage
Chose `localStorage` over `httpOnly` cookies for simplicity in a Vite + Express separated setup. For a production deployment, `httpOnly` cookies with CSRF protection would be the preferred approach.

### Google Auth via Firebase + Custom Backend
Firebase handles the Google OAuth redirect flow. After the redirect returns, the Google user's data (name, email, uid) is sent to a custom `/api/auth/google` endpoint which auto-registers new users and returns a JWT — keeping auth logic consistent across all login methods and avoiding dependency on Firebase session management.

### MongoDB Schema Design
- `Post` model stores `likes` as an array of User ObjectIds — efficient for toggle operations and easily populated for display.
- `Comment` model uses an embedded `replies` sub-document array — avoids a separate collection for a feature with low query complexity and keeps comment + reply data co-located for fast reads.
- Indexes added on `createdAt` for feed sorting and `author + visibility` for filtered queries to support large data scale.

### Visibility Filter at Database Level
The feed query uses a MongoDB `$or` filter to return public posts from all users and private posts only from the logged-in user. This is enforced at the database query level rather than filtering in application code — ensuring private posts are never fetched unnecessarily.

### Optimistic Undo Delete
Post deletion is optimistic on the frontend — the post is removed from state immediately and a 5-second undo toast is shown. The actual `DELETE` API call happens on confirm. If the user clicks Undo, the post is restored to its original index in the list without a refetch — giving a smooth and forgiving user experience.

### Scalability Considerations
- Pagination implemented on the feed (10 posts per page) to avoid loading all posts at once
- MongoDB indexes on high-frequency query fields (`createdAt`, `author`, `visibility`)
- Mongoose `.lean()` used on feed queries to reduce memory overhead
- `Promise.all` used for parallel database calls where possible
- Module-based folder structure (auth, post, comment) for easy horizontal scaling of features
